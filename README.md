# m365-modern-workplace-copilot-project

I designed and built a complete Modern Workplace environment using Microsoft 365 — covering identity, device management, collaboration tools, security, governance, migration, compliance, and Copilot readiness.  
This project walks through how I implement an enterprise M365 platform from the ground up, exactly as I would deliver it in a real organisation.

Across each chapter of this project, I explain how I:

• Build and secure identity and access with Entra ID  
• Onboard and manage Windows and mobile devices using Intune  
• Deploy and manage Microsoft 365 Apps across the organisation  
• Plan and deliver SharePoint Online and OneDrive migrations  
• Configure Microsoft Teams collaboration, channels, external access and security  
• Set up Exchange Online, configure mail flow, connectors and core email governance  
• Implement Microsoft Purview compliance, retention, DLP and data protection policies  
• Deploy Microsoft Defender policies, threat protection and foundational SOC operations  
• Understand core networking, DNS, mail routing and protocols required by Microsoft 365  
• Prepare the organisation for Microsoft 365 Copilot through readiness assessments, governance controls, licensing, security requirements and rollout strategy  

This repository represents how I architect, secure and operate a full Microsoft 365 Modern Workplace environment end-to-end — including identity, devices, apps, collaboration, email, security, compliance and Copilot governance.
