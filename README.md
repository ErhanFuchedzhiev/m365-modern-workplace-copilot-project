# m365-modern-workplace-copilot-project
I design and build a complete Modern Workplace environment using Microsoft 365 — including identity, device management, SharePoint migration, security, governance, and Copilot readiness. This project aligns with my Azure Cloud Migration project and demonstrates how I implement enterprise M365 architecture and Copilot governance.
